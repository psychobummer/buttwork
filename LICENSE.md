1.  ACCORD.

    1.  INSTRUMENT. This present instrument does constitute the Software
        License (the "License") from Psychobummer, a Minnesota limited
        liability company ("Psychobummer"), deviser of the certain
        present software and associated documentation files (the
        "Software") delineated in Exhibit A, and to such person as may
        be reviewing the text of this License or may be contemplating
        the usage of the Software (the "Person") (individually each a
        "Party," collectively the "Parties").
    2.  RECITATION. Psychobummer, in its communal capacity and joint
        ownership of the full and complete copyright in the Software as
        of the year in Exhibit A, hereby promulgates this License with

        in such means as are enumerated henceforth, the Person to engage
        with the Software:

2.  LICENSE.

    1.  NON-COMMERCIAL USES. Permission shall be hereby granted
        forthwith, free of remuneration, to any Person obtaining a copy
        of the said Software, to deal in the said Software without
        restriction for non-commercial uses and non-remunerative
        exploitations, including without limitation the rights to use,
        to duplicate, to modify, to merge, to publish, to distribute,
        and to sublicense reproductions of the said Software, and to
        permit, to authorize, to grant, and to empower any such Person
        to whom the said Software shall be furnished to do so (the
        "Permission"), under the subsequent and successive conditions,
        to wit:

        A.  Any Person making any or divers use of the said Software,
            including any non-commercial uses, must be first, foremost,
            and primarily engaged in or pursuing merrymaking, amusement,
            gratification, jollification, or relaxation. No melancholy,
            painful, torturous, disturbing, mortifying, or other
            disquieting uses of the said Software may be employed for
            any impetus, such as and including torture of any kind,
            except in such cases where any participants have proffered
            informed adult consent to such disquieting uses and, in
            equal measure and without embellishment, do find such
            disquieting uses to be, in truthful fact, pleasurable for
            their very disquietude.
        B.  Any Person making any or divers use of the said Software,
            including any non-commercial uses, may engage in no public
            conduct, make no overt address, and affect no obvious
            comportment signaling, explicitly or impliedly, that such
            Person did not perceive the experience of operating said
            Software to be of a positive caliber.

    2.  COMMERCIAL USES. In the hap that any Person means to use the
        said Software for commercial, pecuniary, or self-aggrandizing
        impetuses, Permission shall be contingent upon the following:

        A.  Any Person who does intend to make any commercial uses of
            the said Software must forthwith swear a perennial pledge of
            loyalty and fealty to Psychobummer, achieved by creating an
            audiovisual recording of such Person appearing weaponless
            and bareheaded in a posture of kneeling with arms
            outstretched proclaiming the following oath in an
            appropriately audible and intelligible way: "I do promise
            upon my faith that I am now and shall be in perpetuity ever
            faithful to Psychobummer, that I shall never occasion
            Psychobummer any injury or harm, and that I shall observe my
            loyalty and fealty to Psychobummer completely vis a vis
            Psychobummer as well as in regards to all other persons in
            sincerity and without duplicity;" whereafter such Person
            shall dispatch such recording to Psychobummer for
            Psychobummer's review. This condition may be abjured by
            Psychobummer in Psychobummer's singular discernment.
        B.  Such divers requisites (the "Commercial Requisites") as
            may be enumerated in Exhibit A.

    3.  GOVERNMENTAL USES. In the hap that any Person intends to use the
        said Software for governmental impetuses, Permission shall be
        contingent upon the following:

        A.  Any Person who does intend to make any governmental uses of
            the said Software must perforce and in advance compel such
            governmental body as may be represented or engaged by such
            Person to open a candid, good faith parley with Psychobummer
            regarding Psychobummer procuring such mineral rights,
            fishery rights, land use rights, or concomitant ownership
            over or exploitation of natural resources as may be
            licensable by the said governmental body, and in fact come
            to such mutual assent with Psychobummer in respect of such
            rights, it being understood and undisputed that such trade
            be considered complete and equitable in consideration and
            effective in effect. This condition may be abjured by
            Psychobummer in Psychobummer's singular discernment.
        B.  Such divers requisites (the "Governmental Requisites") as
            may be enumerated in Exhibit A.

    4.  INTERDICTION. Permission shall be hereby categorically and
        emphatically rebuffed under, and Psychobummer does hereby
        threaten retaliatory measures including legal action, tarring
        and feathering, and defenestration in the hap that any Person
        does flout, the subsequent and successive conditions:

        A.  No Person may make any uses or otherwise avail themselves of
            the said Software in any case in which the Person may be
            that particular individual known to the public and the state
            as Rafael Edward "Ted" Cruz.
        B.  No Person may make any uses or otherwise avail themselves of
            the said Software in any case in which the Person may be one
            of any individual human persons or representatives of
            enterprises, governments, or any other natural or unnatural
            entities regarded by Psychobummer as deplorable,
            disreputable, reprehensible, or otherwise ignoble (the
            "Ignoble Ones") as may be listed in Exhibit A.

3.   MISCELLANEOUS

    1.  NO WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT

        with Exhibit A, must and shall be inserted and included in all

        earnestly endeavor to promulgate amendments to this License to
        preserve the intentions of the License. If that attempt should
        fail, any obligation, provision, or condition deemed invalid
        shall be severed from the remainder of the License, which shall
        remain valid and enforceable.
